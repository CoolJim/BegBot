# BegBot
This is a AutoHotKey script which types "pls beg" every minute or so.
Use this in a discord server which has the 'Dank Memer' bot to make money.

Thanks to C3X0r for the original BegBot project, which seems to have been abandoned or is no longer being worked on. See the original here: https://github.com/C3X0r/BegBot

## Using BegBot
You will need AutoHotKey to be able to run the scripts included. Visit https://www.autohotkey.com/ to download the software. Once installed, double-click the ahk file to start the script. Go to the Discord Channel and press `Ctrl` + `B` to let the script start typing. To stop, do `Ctrl` + `S`.

**Note:** The script will not start typing again until after 40~50 seconds, as there is a cooldown on the `pls beg` command. If it is not typing, please wait a minute or two before reporting it as an issue!
